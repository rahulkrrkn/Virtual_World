  <h1>Pokhran-II</h1>
  <p>
  <div class="ss3">
    The Pokhran-II tests were a series of five nuclear bomb test explosions conducted by India at the Indian Army's
    Pokhran Test Range in May 1998.[3] It was the second instance of nuclear testing conducted by India; the first test,
    code-named Smiling Buddha, was conducted in May 1974.[4]

    The tests achieved their main objective of giving India the capability to build fission and thermonuclear weapons
    with yields up to 200 kilotons.[1] The then-Chairman of the Indian Atomic Energy Commission described each one of
    the explosions of Pokhran-II to be "equivalent to several tests carried out by other nuclear weapon states over
    decades".[5] Subsequently, India established computer simulation capability to predict the yields of nuclear
    explosives whose designs are related to the designs of explosives used in this test.[1]

    Pokhran-II consisted of five detonations, the first of which was a fusion bomb while the remaining four were fission
    bombs.[3] The tests were initiated on 11 May 1998, under the assigned code name Operation Shakti, with the
    detonation of one fusion and two fission bombs.[3] On 13 May 1998, two additional fission devices were detonated,[6]
    and the Indian government led by Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee shortly convened a press conference to declare
    India as a full-fledged nuclear state.[6] The tests resulted in a variety of sanctions against India by a number of
    major countries including Japan and the United States.

    Many names have been assigned to these tests; originally these were collectively called Operation Shakti–98, and the
    five nuclear bombs were designated Shakti-I through to Shakti-V. More recently, the operation as a whole has come to
    be known as Pokhran II, and the 1974 explosion as Pokhran-I

  <h4>Nuclear bomb project</h4>
  <p>
  <div class="ss3">
    Efforts towards building the nuclear bomb, infrastructure, and research on related technologies have been undertaken
    by India since World War II. Origins of India's nuclear program date back to 1944 when nuclear physicist Homi Bhabha
    began persuading the Indian National Congress towards the harnessing of nuclear energy— a year later he established
    the Tata Institute of Fundamental Research (TIFR).[8]

    In 1950s, the preliminary studies were carried out at the BARC and plans were developed to produce plutonium and
    other bomb components. In 1962, India and China engaged in the disputed northern front, and was further intimidated
    with a Chinese nuclear test in 1964. Direction towards militarisation of the nuclear program slowed down when Vikram
    Sarabhai became its head and Lal Bahadur Shastri showed little interest after becoming the Prime Minister in that
    year.[8]

    After Indira Gandhi became Prime Minister in 1966, the nuclear program was consolidated when physicist Raja Ramanna
    joined the efforts. Another nuclear test by China eventually led to India's decision to build nuclear weapons in
    1967 and conduct its first nuclear test, Smiling Buddha, in 1974.</p>

  <h4>Post-Smiling Buddha</h4>
  <p>
  <div class="ss3">
    Responding to Smiling Buddha,[10] the Nuclear Suppliers Group severely affected India's nuclear program.[11] The
    world's major nuclear powers imposed technological embargo on India and Pakistan, which was on its own technological
    race to match India's achievement.[11] The nuclear program struggled for years to gain credibility and its progress
    was crippled by the lack of indigenous resources and dependence on imported technology and technical assistance.[11]
    Prime Minister Indira Gandhi declared to the IAEA that India's nuclear program was not for military purposes,
    despite authorising preliminary work on the hydrogen bomb design.

    The primary objective of the mission is to develop the technologies required for designing, planning, management and
    operations of an interplanetary mission.[25] The secondary objective is to explore Mars' surface features,
    morphology, mineralogy and Martian atmosphere using indigenous scientific instruments.
    The main objectives are to develop the technologies required for designing, planning, management and operations of
    an interplanetary mission comprising the following major tasks:
    Having tested weaponized nuclear warheads in the Pokhran-II series, India became the sixth country to join the
    nuclear club.[25] Shortly after the tests, a press meet was convened at the Prime Minister's residence in New Delhi.
    Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee appeared before the press corps and made the following short statement:

    Today, at 15:45 hours, India conducted three underground nuclear tests in the Pokhran range. The tests conducted
    today were with a fission device, a low yield device and a thermonuclear device. The measured yields are in line
    with expected values. Measurements have also confirmed that there was no release of radioactivity into the
    atmosphere. These were contained explosions like the experiment conducted in May 1974. I warmly congratulate the
    scientists and engineers who have carried out these successful tests.
