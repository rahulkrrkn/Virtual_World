    <strong><b> Rate of growth-:</b></strong><br><br>
    Size of the economy<br>

    South Mumbai skyline and Mahim Bay<br>
    In 2011, under the Manmohan Singh government, India was recognized as the third largest economy according to World
    Bank data.[5]<br> This was a significant accomplishment and a result of Manmohan Singh's policies.[6]<br> In 1991,
    India was ranked 17th in terms of its economy size, but Manmohan Singh's policies helped spur rapid growth that
    continued despite the global financial crisis. However, the momentum slowed down due to several civil society
    movements, such as Anna Hazare's anti-corruption movement, that impacted the congress government between 2011 and
    2012.[7]<br> In 2015, Modi government's demonitization struck a lethal blow to the Indian economy.[8] Despite this,
    the country's large human and natural resources and educated middle class demographic helped it recover. In 2019,
    India was the 5th largest economy.[9] The COVID-19 Pandemic dealt another blow to the Indian economy, but it was
    able to bounce back, unlike many western European countries. In 2020 India was the 6th largest economy.[9] <br>In
    2022, India overtook the United Kingdom as the world's fifth largest economy, which suffered greatly from COVID-19
    and failed to fully recover. According to some economists, it may take India another 7 years to regain its third
    position, which it achieved in 2011 under the Manmohan Singh government.[9][10][11][12]


    The Delhi–Meerut Expressway,the widest expressway in India with 14 lanes
    In terms of GDP (PPP) per capita India ranked at 125th largest economy in 2020, 2021, and 2022.<br> Its rank was 139
    in terms of GDP (nominal) per capita. However, if per capita considerations are removed, by virtue of sheer size of
    India and its population, India jumps to the world's fifth largest in terms of GDP (nominal) and the third largest
    in terms of real GDP (PPP), after the United States of America and the People's Republic of China. It is noteworthy
    that this status was achieved in 2011 during the Manmohan Singh government.

    <strong><b> Economic factors</b></strong><br><br></p>
    India experienced a period of rapid growth after 1991 due to the efforts of Narasimha Rao and Manmohan Singh to
    liberalize the economy.[14]<br> However, this growth was later slowed by instability at the center. Nevertheless,
    the Indian economy regained momentum during the Manmohan Singh government between 2004 and 2011, before slowing down
    once again as a result of the global financial crisis.<br> In January 2015, India adopted a new way of calculating
    the GDP,[15] suddenly appearing as the fastest-growing major economy in the world, overtaking China.[16] When this
    new method was applied to the UPA rule under Manmoha Singh, the gowth during that period jumped to 10.08 percent,
    highest since independence.<strong><b> Economic factors<br><br>
        <b> Science and technology-:</b><br><br></p>
        India is prioritising the development of a well-trained workforce with advanced English language skills to fit
        into the emerging knowledge economy.[29][30][31][32] <br>An example of India's scientific endeavours is the
        ISRO, the third National Space Agency to be founded in the world, following those of the Soviet Union and the
        United States. It enabled India to become the third Asian nation to launch a satellite into orbit from an
        indigenously developed rocket after China and Japan, when the Rohini RS-1 lifted off in 1979.[33][34]<br> In
        January 2007, India became the fourth nation to complete atmospheric reentry[35] In October 2008, India launched
        its first unmanned lunar probe, Chandrayaan 1, which operated until August 2009.[36][37][38] On 14 November
        2008, the Moon Impact Probe separated from the Chandrayaan orbiter and was made to strike the Moon near its
        south pole, making India the fourth country to reach the Moon's surface.<br> The probe discoved widespread water
        molecules in lunar soil. On 24 September 2014, India became the fourth nation to have a satellite orbiting Mars.
        India is the first Asian nation to achieve this and the first in the world to do so at the first attempt.[39]
        India and the United States have increased mutual co-operation in space-travel related technologies, such as
        increasing the interoperability between Indian and US systems, and prospects for a commercial space launch
        agreement with India that would allow US satellites to be launched on Indian vehicles.[40]<br> India is also
        trying to join international R&D projects - e.g. it has recently joined the European Galileo GPS Project[41] and
        the ITER for fusion energy club.[42] India also holds a world record for placing 104 satellites in orbit by
        single launch. India recently launched Chandrayaan-2 mission to moon which had included a lander and rover. It
        also has a planned space mission called Gaganyaan (Indian Human spaceflight) to send a human to space by 2024.
        Planned space missions include Chandrayaan-3, Mars Orbiter Mission 2, Shukrayaan-1 and space exploration
        satellites as well as the ISRO space station to enter service by 2030.<br> India has several educational and
        research institutions of global repute, including the Indian Institute of Science, Indian Institute of
        Technology,[43] National Institutes of Technology, Indian Institutes of Information Technology, IISER,[44]BITS
        Pilani, Indian Institute of Management, Tata Institute of Fundamental Research and All India Institute of
        Medical Sciences.<br><br>
        <b> Tourism-:</b><br><br>
        India continues to attract tourists with the attractions of its history, arts, music, culture and spiritual
        traditions.[61]<br> About 3.9 million tourists travelled to India in 2005, each spending an average of $1,470 ,
        higher than in France, the most visited tourist destination in the world.[61]<br> Foreign visitors contributed
        over US$15.4 billion to the indian economy in 2005.[62][63][64] Many travellers find the cultural diversity an
        enriching experience, despite hassles, inefficiency, pollution and overcrowding.[65] Monuments like the Taj
        Mahal are among the many attractions of this land.[66][67] As of 2006, Conde Nast Traveller ranked India the 4th
        most preferred travel destination.[61]<br> The Planning Commission expects 5.8 million tourists travelling to
        India by 2010. The World Travel and Tourism Council believes India's tourism industry will grow at 10% per annum
        in the next decade, making it lead the world in terms of growth.[61] Tourism contributes 6% of India's GDP and
        employs 40 million people, making it an important factor in India's economic growth.[61]<br> More than 8 million
        foreign tourists arrived in the year 2015 against 7.68 million in 2014 recording a growth of 4.4 percent over
        2014.<br><br>

      Democratic republicanism has its value, more so in a multi-ethnic country like India.<br> However, the
      applicability of the "theoretical" virtues of republicanism on a country like India is sometimes
      questioned.[137][138][139] <br>Some thinkers consider India's diverse democracy to levy a huge tax on its
      economy.[140] The Indian government has to consider many interest groups before decision making.<br> However,
      India is relatively a much younger republic when compared to other major democracies. Moreover, it is predicted
      that in the long run, India being a democracy will provide it an edge over non-democratic[citation needed]
      competitors like China.<br>

  <h4>India the next superpower?</h4>
  <p>
  <div class="ss3">
    Being a superpower can be defined as the extensive ability to exert influence on an international scale.<br><br>

    It is the state of possessing the might, both economic and military that is superior in comparison to other
    countries.<br><br>


    According to the 'World Population Review 2021,' the powerful country in the world is the United States, followed by
    China, Russia, Germany, and the United Kingdom.<br><br>

    The survey ranks 80 countries on the basis of five criteria: international and military alliances, political and
    economic influence, and leadership skills.<br><br>
  </Div>
  </p>
  <h4>Why India is a superpower </h4>
  <p>
  <div class="ss3">
    Political experts have also considered India as one of the possible emerging superpowers of the world along with
    China, Brazil, Russia, and the European Union. Currently,<br> only the United States fulfills the criteria to be
    considered a global superpower. India's rising economy and burgeoning middle class have earned it a place alongside
    China as one of the world's indispensable emerging markets and offer it offers a position of superpower in Asia. But
    what is India’s true potential?<br> And what can be done to unlock it? We shall be dealing with India’s performance
    in various sectors and understand how far we are from becoming a superpower.
    <ul>
      <li>The Non-Aligned Movement had become an effective means of promoting India’s diplomatic presence and the means
        of securing economic assistance internationally.</li>
      <li>India’s proud nonalignment during the Cold War had given it a leadership role in the developing world, its
        21st-century position places it at the heart of superpower geopolitics.</li>
      <li>Middle East quad: Middle East quad is a reflection of the understanding that the China challenge is not just a
        military one but a far broader matter including political and economic aspects.</li>
      <li>India is sitting in the 15-nation UNSC for the 2021-22 term as a non-permanent member — the eighth time that
        the country has had a seat on the powerful horseshoe table. India is a strong voice for the developing world in
        the UNSC.</li>
      <li>Young Population: India enjoys the advantage of having a young population. It is estimated that, in 2020, an
        average person will only be 29 years old in India, which is much younger when compared with many developed
        countries such as the US, and EU.</li>
      <li>It is the world's fifth-largest economy by nominal GDP and the third-largest by purchasing power parity (PPP)
        and it is the fourth most powerful country in Asia, as per the Lowy Institute Asia Power Index 2021. India
        finishes in 4th place in four other measures: economic capability, military, capability, resilience, and
        cultural influence.</li>
